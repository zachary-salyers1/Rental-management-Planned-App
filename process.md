8. Implement the Bookings page:
   - Build the Bookings component with booking listing and management features
   - Create add, edit, and delete functionality for bookings
   - Implement contract upload and management features

9. Develop the Calendar page:

15. Implement authentication and authorization:
    - Set up user authentication system
    - Implement role-based access control if required

16. Conduct thorough testing:
    - Perform unit testing for individual components
    - Conduct integration testing for page interactions
    - Test responsiveness and cross-browser compatibility

17. Documentation and code cleanup:
    - Add comments to explain complex logic
    - Update the README.md with setup instructions and project overview
    - Refactor and optimize code where necessary

18. Prepare for deployment:
    - Set up environment variables for different deployment environments
    - Configure build scripts and optimization settings

19. Deploy the application:
    - Choose a hosting platform (e.g., Vercel, Netlify)
    - Deploy the application to a staging environment for final testing

20. Post-deployment tasks:
    - Monitor the application for any issues
    - Gather user feedback for future improvements
    - Plan for ongoing maintenance and feature enhancements
